**Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
----------------------------

### **Q1. What is Azure Data Factory, and why is it used in data engineering?**

**Answer:** Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation. It is used in data engineering to:

1.  Ingest data from various sources (e.g., HTTP, SQL databases, APIs).

2.  Transform data using tools like Databricks.

3.  Load data into destinations such as Azure Data Lake or Synapse Analytics.

### **Q2. How do you create and schedule a pipeline in ADF?**

**Answer:** To create and schedule a pipeline in ADF:

1.  Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to ADF.

2.  Create a new pipeline using the visual editor.

3.  Add activities like "Copy Data" or "Data Flow".

4.  Configure the source and sink datasets.

5.  Test the pipeline and publish it.

6.  Use triggers to schedule the pipeline for execution.

**Tag:** Commonly asked by Microsoft, Infosys, and TCS.

### **Q3. Explain the difference between Mapping Data Flow and Wrangling Data Flow in ADF.**

**Answer:**

-   **Mapping Data Flow:** A visual data transformation tool for scalable ETL processes. Best for structured data transformations.

-   **Wrangling Data Flow:** Uses Power Query for data preparation and exploration. Best for ad hoc or exploratory data tasks.

**Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)**
---------------------------------------

### **Q4. What is ADLS Gen2, and why is it significant in a data engineering architecture?**

**Answer:** ADLS Gen2 is a scalable, high-performance cloud storage solution optimized for big data analytics. Key features include:

1.  Hierarchical file system for fast access.

2.  Integration with analytics tools like Databricks and Synapse.

3.  Secure data storage with access control and encryption.

### **Q5. How do you secure data in ADLS Gen2?**

**Answer:**

1.  Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access.

2.  Implement firewall and virtual network rules.

3.  Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

4.  Monitor access using Azure Monitor or Azure Sentinel.

**Tag:** Asked in Accenture, Capgemini.

**Azure Databricks and Spark**
------------------------------

### **Q6. What is Azure Databricks, and how does it integrate with Spark?**

**Answer:** Azure Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform optimized for Apache Spark. It provides a collaborative workspace for:

1.  Big data processing with Spark clusters.

2.  Machine learning workflows.

3.  Integration with ADLS and Synapse.

**Tag:** Popular question in FAANG companies.

### **Q7. What are the key benefits of using Apache Spark for big data processing?**

**Answer:**

1.  **Speed:** In-memory computation is much faster than disk-based processing.

2.  **Scalability:** Can handle petabytes of data.

3.  **Flexibility:** Supports multiple languages (Python, Scala, Java, R).

4.  **Rich APIs:** Provides libraries for ML (MLlib), SQL (Spark SQL), and streaming.

**Azure Synapse Analytics**
---------------------------

### **Q8. What is the difference between a Serverless SQL Pool and a Dedicated SQL Pool in Synapse?**

**Answer:**

-   **Serverless SQL Pool:** Pay-as-you-go model for querying data directly in the data lake without loading it into a database.

-   **Dedicated SQL Pool:** A provisioned data warehouse for high-performance queries.

### **Q9. Can Synapse be used as a data lakehouse? If yes, explain how.**

**Answer:** Yes, Synapse can function as a data lakehouse by:

1.  Storing data in ADLS Gen2 (data lake).

2.  Querying data directly using Serverless SQL Pools.

3.  Combining structured and unstructured data for analytics.

**Tag:** Frequently asked by AWS, Google Cloud teams, and Snowflake interviewers.

**General Data Engineering Questions**
--------------------------------------

### **Q10. What is the medallion architecture, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** The medallion architecture organizes data into three layers:

1.  **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion.

2.  **Silver Layer:** Cleaned and transformed data.

3.  **Gold Layer:** Business-level aggregates for analytics.

It ensures data quality, improves scalability, and simplifies data processing workflows.

### **Q11. How would you explain the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse?**

**Answer:**

-   **Data Lake:** Stores structured and unstructured data in its raw form. Suitable for big data processing.

-   **Data Warehouse:** Stores structured data optimized for analytics. Suitable for reporting and business intelligence.

**Tag:** Common at IBM, Deloitte, and KPMG.

**Scenario-Based Questions**
----------------------------

### **Q12. If your pipeline in ADF fails at 2 a.m., how would you debug and resolve the issue?**

**Answer:**

1.  Use the ADF monitoring tools to identify the failed activity.

2.  Check the error message and logs for details.

3.  Verify the source and sink connectivity.

4.  Test the pipeline manually to reproduce the issue.

5.  Apply a fix, such as updating credentials or correcting mapping errors.

6.  Rerun the pipeline and monitor for successful execution.

### **Q13. How do you optimize the performance of Spark jobs in Azure Databricks?**

**Answer:**

1.  Use caching to store intermediate results.

2.  Optimize data partitions.

3.  Use columnar storage formats like Parquet.

4.  Avoid wide transformations like groupByKey.

5.  Tune cluster configurations (e.g., memory, cores).

**Tag:** Popular at Databricks, Cloudera, and Hortonworks interviews.
