### **Azure Synapse Analytics**

1.  **What is Azure Synapse Analytics, and how does it differ from traditional data warehouses?**

    -   **Answer:** Azure Synapse Analytics is a fully integrated service that combines big data and data warehousing capabilities into a unified platform. It enables serverless and provisioned options for running queries, analyzing structured and unstructured data, and performing advanced analytics. Unlike traditional data warehouses, Synapse supports seamless integration with Azure Data Lake, enables distributed processing with Spark pools, and uses T-SQL for familiar querying.

2.  **Explain the purpose of the OPENROWSET function in Azure Synapse Analytics.**

    -   **Answer:** OPENROWSET is a function that facilitates direct querying of external data sources, such as Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake, without the need to load the data into tables. It simplifies data exploration and shortens development time when working with raw datasets.

3.  **Describe the purpose of external tables in Synapse Analytics.**

    -   **Answer:** External tables provide a schema definition for data stored in external systems like ADLS or Blob Storage. They allow querying and analyzing this data directly from Synapse, eliminating the need for data duplication or ingestion into Synapse storage.

4.  **What is the role of master keys and database-scoped credentials in Synapse?**

    -   **Answer:** Master keys encrypt sensitive data like credentials, enabling secure access to external data sources. Database-scoped credentials establish a secure link between the Synapse database and external data sources, ensuring authorized access.

5.  **How would you optimize the performance of queries in Synapse?**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   Use materialized views for precomputed results.

        -   Partition large datasets for efficient querying.

        -   Optimize file formats, preferring Parquet over CSV.

        -   Leverage caching and indexing to speed up queries.

        -   Configure resource classes to allocate compute resources effectively.

### **Apache Spark**

1.  **What are the key differences between DataFrame and RDD in Spark?**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   **DataFrame:** A higher-level abstraction optimized for structured data, supporting SQL-like operations and benefiting from Catalyst query optimization.

        -   **RDD:** A lower-level abstraction for distributed collections that provides granular control but lacks the optimizations of DataFrames.

2.  **How does Spark handle fault tolerance?**

    -   **Answer:** Spark uses RDD lineage to recover lost data. It logs transformations in a lineage graph, allowing recomputation of lost partitions in the event of node failure.

3.  **Explain the role of the driver and executors in Spark.**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   **Driver:** Coordinates the Spark application by scheduling tasks, tracking progress, and managing metadata.

        -   **Executors:** Perform the actual computation and store data in memory or disk as needed.

4.  **What are the advantages of using Parquet files in Spark?**

    -   **Answer:** Parquet is a columnar storage format that supports efficient compression and enables predicate pushdown for faster queries, making it ideal for big data workloads.

5.  **How do you tune a Spark application for performance?**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   Allocate appropriate executor memory and cores.

        -   Optimize shuffle partitions.

        -   Leverage broadcast joins for small datasets.

        -   Cache frequently accessed data to reduce recomputation.

### **Hadoop Ecosystem**

1.  **What are the primary components of the Hadoop ecosystem?**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   **HDFS:** A distributed storage system that handles large-scale data storage.

        -   **MapReduce:** A framework for processing large datasets in a distributed manner.

        -   **YARN:** A resource management layer that schedules jobs and manages cluster resources.

        -   **Hive, Pig:** Tools for querying and scripting on large datasets.

2.  **How does HDFS ensure data reliability?**

    -   **Answer:** HDFS replicates data blocks across multiple nodes (default replication factor is 3). This redundancy ensures data availability even in case of node failures.

3.  **Explain the difference between NameNode and DataNode.**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   **NameNode:** Manages metadata, such as file names and block locations.

        -   **DataNode:** Stores the actual data blocks and handles read/write requests from clients.

4.  **What is the role of YARN in Hadoop?**

    -   **Answer:** YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is responsible for managing cluster resources and scheduling tasks in the Hadoop ecosystem.

5.  **What are the limitations of Hadoop, and how does Spark address them?**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   Hadoop relies heavily on disk, resulting in slower performance.

        -   Spark improves performance with in-memory computation, significantly reducing processing time.

### **Data Engineering Workflow Questions**

1.  **Explain the concept of a data lake and how it differs from a data warehouse.**

    -   **Answer:** A data lake is designed for storing raw, unprocessed data in its original format, catering to big data use cases. A data warehouse stores structured, processed data optimized for analytics and reporting.

2.  **What is the purpose of the "gold layer" in a data lake architecture?**

    -   **Answer:** The gold layer contains fully cleaned, transformed, and enriched data, ready for analytics or visualization in tools like Power BI.

3.  **How do you ensure data quality in a data pipeline?**

    -   **Answer:**

        -   Validate data against predefined rules.

        -   Use monitoring and alerting tools for pipeline health.

        -   Enforce schemas to detect anomalies early.

4.  **What are the common challenges faced in building data pipelines?**
